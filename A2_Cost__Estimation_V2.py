# Cost Estimation V2
'''
First: This is post-A2 and will only consider the cost of our selected aircraft, AT-V1 (the first design)

Second: All equations/Factors (Variables that start with "F_") come from Finger et al. source, Section 2 [Finger S.2] unless otherwise commented
(or are determined by our design).Many of these equations use the same factors, however the value of those factors change depending on the cost 
one is examining. Because of this, any variable that changes value in subsequent equations will be assigned that new value before that next equation.
This may make the code look messy... oh well

Third: Equations are modified slighty, namely they do not consider F_cert in the original equations. The choice for this is due to a lack of
knowledge in the certification process, as well as we just haven't covered the certifications required (besides FAR 25) in the RFP. Additionally, Prof. Harvey believes
it won't be relevant for this case.

Fourth: This uses W_TO, W_Bat, and P_SHP values that were from initial estimations. W_TO, W_Bat, and P_SHP (P_TO) are calculated among others in A4 as dimensional values,
and should be used if possible. To highlight where these substitutes were used, look for "************************************** " in comments
