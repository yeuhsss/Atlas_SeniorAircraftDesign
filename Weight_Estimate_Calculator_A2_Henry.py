Description:
    To calculate the weight parameters for the designed aircraft you must provide:
        1) passengers (The Number of Passangers)
            Note: Assumes that for every 50 passengers there are 2 pilots and 1 cabin member
        2) mission (Supply a list of strings describing the phases of the mission)
            Possible Entries: Warmup, Taxi, Takeoff, Climb, Cruise, Loitter, Descent, Landing
        3) hybridization_factors (List of idential size to "mission" of values between 
                                  0 (pure gas power) and 1 (pure electric power))
            Note: The values of the mission stage and hybridization factor are indexed together, list must
            be in order of the mission
        4) R (Range in nautical miles (nmi))
        5) c (Fuel Burn of the gas turboprop (lbm / (lbf * hr)))
        6) nu (Battery Efficency (Dimensionless Quanitity between (0 and 1)))
        7) Cl_Cd (Lift / Drag Ratio)
        8) E (Endurance in hours (Used for loitter fuel weight ratio calculations))
        9) V_inf (Cruise speed in knots)
        10) e_star (Battery Energy Density (wS/kg))
        11) A (Empty Weight Factor Coefficent 1)
        12) C (Emply Weight Factor Coefficent 2)
            Note: Empty Weight Factor We / W0 = A * W0 ** C

Important: If the output is infinity it means that the weight of the battery exceeds 
the weight of the aircraft, therefore the plane is impossible.
